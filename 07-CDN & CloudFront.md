## 📝 Introduction
- **Mixtures**: A combination of two or more substances that are not chemically combined and can be separated by physical means.
- **Types of Mixtures**: 
  - **Homogeneous Mixture**: Uniform composition throughout (e.g., saltwater).
  - **Heterogeneous Mixture**: Non-uniform composition (e.g., sand in water).

## 🔬 Properties of Mixtures
- **Physical Properties**: 
  - Components retain their individual properties.
  - Can be separated by physical means such as filtration, distillation, or evaporation.
  
- **Chemical Properties**: 
  - No new substances are formed.
  - No chemical bonding occurs between the components.

## 🛠️ Methods of Separation
### 1. 🧹 **Filtration**
   - Used to separate insoluble solids from liquids (e.g., sand from water).
   - **Apparatus**: Filter paper, funnel, beaker.

### 2. 🌡️ **Distillation**
   - Separation of liquids based on boiling points.
   - **Types**:
     - **Simple Distillation**: Separates liquids with significantly different boiling points.
     - **Fractional Distillation**: Separates liquids with close boiling points.

### 3. ☀️ **Evaporation**
   - Removes a liquid from a mixture to leave a solid behind.
   - **Example**: Obtaining salt from saltwater.

### 4. 🖌️ **Chromatography**
   - Separates components based on their movement through a stationary phase.
   - **Types**:
     - **Paper Chromatography**: Used for separating colors.
     - **Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)**: Used for identifying compounds.

### 5. 🌀 **Centrifugation**
   - Separates based on density differences using centrifugal force.
   - **Example**: Separating cream from milk.

## 🍽️ Applications of Mixtures
- **Pharmaceuticals**: Formulation of drugs.
- **Food Industry**: Production of food items like butter, cheese, etc.
- **Environmental Science**: Treatment of water by removing impurities.

## 📚 Summary
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Mixtures are physical combinations of substances.
  - They can be homogeneous or heterogeneous.
  - Various physical methods are employed for separating mixtures.

## ❓ Sample Questions

1. **What is the difference between a homogeneous and a heterogeneous mixture?**
   - **Answer**: A homogeneous mixture has a uniform composition throughout, while a heterogeneous mixture has a non-uniform composition.

2. **Explain the principle behind distillation.**
   - **Answer**: Distillation separates components of a mixture based on their boiling points by heating the mixture until one component evaporates, then condensing the vapor to collect the liquid.

3. **How can chromatography be used to separate a mixture?**
   - **Answer**: Chromatography separates mixture components based on their movement through a stationary phase, with different substances moving at different rates.
